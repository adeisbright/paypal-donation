Make a donation

To make donation, we expect that the button_id of the recipient is provided in the url that is called from the mobile app. 

If we get our url in this format : [https://adeisbright.github.io/paypal-donation/](https://adeisbright.github.io/paypal-donation/)
It should return an error as seen on the page. 

The current way to load the page is [https://adeisbright.github.io/paypal-donation/?button_id=J7QVYCU24W5M8](https://adeisbright.github.io/paypal-donation/?button_id=J7QVYCU24W5M8)
